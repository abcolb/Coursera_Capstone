# Identifying areas of opportunity in Bangkok for food delivery service platforms with Local Moran's I
### IBM Data Science Capstone

Local Moran's I (I=0.241, p=0.0048) of 83 Bangkok districts' venue value per capita identified one hot spot (4 districts),  one cold spot (2 districts) and one geospatial outlier for targeted prospecting and market research. Sensitivity analysis produces an area of interest of districts which self-cluster into the entire southwest region (17 districts). Recommendations to a hypothetical business were made, starting with immediate prospecting in 'doughnut' outliers, which have potential to provide high value like their neighbors. Then, assuming saturation has not been met, hot spot regions would benefit from a specialized campaign and continuous prospecting as they are providing high value and new stores there are likely to also be high-value. Longer-term efforts include cold spot user research to understand why the cold spot is providing less value and adjust marketing strategies in this area. It might take effort to convert these regions.
